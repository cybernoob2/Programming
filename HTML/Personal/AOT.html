            Attack on Titan  is a Japanese dark fantasy anime television series, adapted from the manga series of the same name by Hajime Isayama.
            Set in a post-apocalyptic world where the remains of humanity live behind walls protecting them from giant humanoid Titans, Attack on 
            Titan follows protagonist Eren Yeager, along with friends Mikasa Ackerman and Armin Arlert. When a Colossal Titan breaches the wall 
            of their hometown, Titans destroy the city and eat Eren's mother. Vowing vengeance, Eren joins the elite Survey Corps, a group of 
            soldiers who fight against Titans. &copy

        <h2>Synopsis</h2>
        <p>
            The story of Attack on Titan centers on a civilization inside three circular walls. According to the knowledge propagated locally, it
            is the last surviving vestige of human civilization. Its inhabitants, known as Eldians, have been led to believe that over one hundred
            years ago, humanity was driven to the brink of extinction after the emergence of humanoid giants called Titans, who attack and eat 
            humans on sight. The last remnants of humanity retreated behind three concentric walls and enjoyed roughly a century of peace. Within
            the walls, the thought of venturing outside is strongly frowned upon and discouraged. To combat Titans, the country's military employs
            Vertical Maneuvering Equipment (VME), also called Omni-Directional Maneuvering Gear (ODM Gear): a set of waist-mounted grappling 
            hooks and gas-powered propulsion enabling mobility in three dimensions. Swords made of ultrahard steel are used in conjunction with 
            the gear, and eventually rocket launcherâ€“like weapons called Thunder Spears are developed. There are different types of Titans. Pure
            Titans are the weakest and most generic, whose behavior is easy to predict, making them easy to kill. Abnormal Titans are Pure Titans
            whose behavior is more difficult to predict, making them far more dangerous. The Nine Titans, also known as Titan Shifters (Attack,
            Colossal, Armored, Female, Beast, Jaw, Cart, War Hammer, and Founding), are the strongest Titans; each is able to shift back forth 
            between human and Titan form to access their Titan's abilities. Many Titan Shifters possess the ability to harden certain 
            parts of their bodies at will, typically in order to make them virtually impenetrable, or to strengthen their blows during combat.
            Pure Titans are created by injecting Eldians with Titan spinal fluid. If a Pure Titan eats the human body of a person who possesses one of
            the Nine Titans, said Eldian will revert to human form and gain that Shifter's powers, whereupon they are cursed to live only 13 more years.
            If their powers are not inherited by another Eldian before their death, their powers will be inherited by an Eldian baby born shortly 
            thereafter, regardless of distance or blood-relations. As the story progresses, the true nature of the Titans and the existence of 
            civilization outside the walls is revealed.
